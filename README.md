# Studio Ghibli Website
Since the API isnt hosted on the internet anymore I decided to make a quick modification of [my previous website](https://github.com/Loksyy/ghibliwebsite).
It is relatively the same code except that its using a local json file.

## How to use this website
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Loksyy/ghiblitsite
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Start the server (its automatically set on the 8080 port)
```
npm start
```
